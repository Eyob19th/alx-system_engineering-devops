Issue Summary
Duration of the Outage: The outage lasted for 2 hours, from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM GMT on October 15, 2023.
Impact: The main website was down, causing a disruption in service for approximately 45% of our users.
Root Cause: A misconfiguration in the load balancer led to an overload of the primary server.
Timeline
10:05 AM: The issue was detected by our automated monitoring system which alerted the on-call engineer.
10:15 AM: Initial investigation pointed towards a network issue. Network logs were checked but no issues were found.
10:45 AM: The issue was escalated to the site reliability team.
11:00 AM: Further investigation revealed that the load balancer was not distributing network traffic evenly.
11:30 AM: A fix was implemented and the service was partially restored.
12:00 PM: Full service was restored.
Root Cause and Resolution
The root cause of the issue was a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings. This caused all traffic to be directed to one server, leading to an overload and subsequent service disruption.
The issue was resolved by correcting the configuration settings and redistributing the network traffic evenly across all servers.
Corrective and Preventative Measures
To prevent this from happening in the future, we will improve our change management procedures to ensure all configuration changes are reviewed and tested before implementation.
We will also enhance our monitoring system to detect anomalies in network traffic distribution.
